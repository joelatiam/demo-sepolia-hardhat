# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract, and a script to update the contract variable.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Contract.ts --network localhost
npx hardhat run scripts/changeX.ts --network localhost
```
